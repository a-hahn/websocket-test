websocket-test
==============

setup websocket with spring framework &lt; 4.0

This is a very simple version based on the originals 'annotationless'-branch.
As it doesn't run in ubuntus most recent distro 14.04 server because the installation
unfortunateley misses 2 important jars these are included here (from tomcat V7.0.52).

War should run out-of-the-box in ubuntu 14.04
